Hello there! I'm Melanie a Chilean ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± researcher, working in the computational social science space. Currently I live in Budapest, where I am doing a postdoc at the Center for Collective Learning (https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/) within the Center for Advanced Studies at Corvinus University.

My background is in Economics and I studied a PhD in Complexity Sciences from Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD) in Chile (https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl/). Regressions are my jam!

My research focuses on social relations and cooperation within educational settings and the social externalities of education. I also explore other interesting topics such as collective memory and urban inequality.

I love technology, enjoy reading comics and fantasy, and exploring new (to me) cities.

This is my personal website. It follows the Hugo Apero template, by Alisson Hill.
