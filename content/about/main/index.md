  My research focuses on social relations and cooperation within educational settings and the social externalities of education. I also explore other interesting topics such as collective memory and urban inequality.

  I studied a PhD in Social Complexity Sciences in [Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD)](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl/) in Chile. There I focused on on applying a computational social science framework to study social interactions within educational settings, blending experimental game theory, social network analysis, and regression methods.

  I have a background in Applied Microeconomics, particularly impact evaluation using econometric tools. I hold a Masters in Economics @ Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) and previously studied Commercial Engeneering @ Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV).

  Before my PhD I taught Introductory Economics, Microeconomics and Game Theory at PUCV between 2013 and 2019 , and have taught courses in the Data Science department at Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD).
  
  Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, reading fantasy, and comics.
