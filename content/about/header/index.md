My name is Melanie Oyarzun, I'm from Chile and currently studying a Ph.D. in Social Complexity Sciences at Universidad del Desarollo in the [Center for Social Complexity Sciences](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) (CICS in Spanish).

Currently, I'm studying social interaction patterns in students' educational experiences with a computational social sciences approach. My supervisor is [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav).

We combine experimental game theory, network, and quantitative data analysis methods to study social interaction, cooperation, and reciprocity in classroom environments.

Since November, I've been in Toulouse, France, as a Visiting Ph.D. at the [Center for Collective Learning](https://centerforcollectivelearning.org), working with [Cesar Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com) and [Mariana Macedo](https://sites.google.com/view/marianagmmacedo/home) on a couple of projects.
