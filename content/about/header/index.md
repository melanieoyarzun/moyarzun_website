My name is Melanie Oyarzun, I'm from Chile and currently studyng Phd in Social Complexity Sciences \@ Universidad del Desarollo in the [Center for Social Complexity Sciences](https://complejidadsocial.udd.cl) (CICS in spanish).

Currently, I'm studyng social interaction patterns in students' educational experience with a computational social sciences approach. My supervisor is [Cristian Candia](https://linktr.ee/crcandiav).

We combine experimental game theory, network and quantitative data analysis methods to study social interaction, cooperation and reciprocity in classroom environments.
