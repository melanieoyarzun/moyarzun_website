<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I'm a Chilean ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± researcher, working in the computational social science space. Currently, I live in Budapest, where I am doing a postdoc at the [Center for Collective Learning](https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/) within the Center for Advanced Studies at Corvinus University.

My research focuses on social relations and cooperation within educational settings and the social externalities of education. I also explore other interesting topics such as collective memory and urban inequality.
