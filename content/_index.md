  Hello there! I'm Melanie! Currently I am a Phd candidate in Social Complexity Sciences,
  at Universidad Del Desarrollo, Chile.\nI’m studying social interaction patterns in
  students’ educational experience with a computational social sciences approach,
  combining experimental game theory, network and quantitative data analysis methods
  to study social interaction, cooperation and reciprocity in classroom environments.
