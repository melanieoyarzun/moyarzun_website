description: Hello there! I'm Melanie, and I'm excited to welcome you to my personal corner of the web. Here, you'll explore a collection of my thoughts, research, and insights into the fascinating intersection of data and human behavior. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Social Complexity Sciences at Universidad Del Desarrollo, Chile. My research focuses on studying social interaction patterns within students' educational experiences, utilizing a computational social sciences approach. By combining experimental game theory, network analysis, and quantitative data analysis methods, I aim to understand concepts such as cooperation, reciprocity, inclusion, and academic success within classroom environments.
